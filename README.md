# Projects

We learn by creating. So, alongside my journey of learning software engineering, I have made some interesting projects which I am proud of. Here is a list:

- **[The Most Dangerous Writing App Extension](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/the-most-dangerous-writing-app-extension)** The vscode extension version of [the Most Dangerous Writing App](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp).
It eliminates everything you write if you stop typing for 5 seconds. You can install it from [Vscode Extensions Marketplace](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/the-most-dangerous-writing-app-extension).

- **Sorta** (_This project is work in progress_) A language agnostic visualization tool that animates sorting algorithms.
    
    - **Sorta** (WIP): the frontend, creates animations of sorting algorithms by steps retrieved from backend API.

    - **[Sorta.Net](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/sorta.net)** (Done) The C# implementation of the backend API. It generates steps that represent the operations during sorting algorithms, and sends these to the frontend for visualization.

- **[Gomoku](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/gomoku)** A Gomoku game built with Golang. It is a command-line game, yet it looks pretty. It uses WebSocket for real-time gaming, and supports rooms and chatting.

- **[GitClock](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/gitclock)** An app that shows your Github clock type by analyzing your commit history. It was built with React and TypeScript and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://coderyihaowang.github.io/gitclock/).

- **[Colorful Life](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/colorfullife)** A fancier version of Conway's game of life, it supports various configurations and can be used to create generative art. It was built with React with TypeScript and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://coderyihaowang.github.io/ColorfulLife/).

- **[yBlog](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/yblog)** A theme for the static site generator Hugo. It is unique in that it treats the app bar as a command pallete so that one can run commands on the blog page. It was created using Hugo and Go's templating feature, and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://coderyihaowang.github.io/yBlog/).

- **[Div](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/div)** Div is a turing-complete functional programming language. It allows you write programs directly using HTML tags. The interpreter, which is just an inserted `<script>` link, will parse all the tags on the page, and treat them as language structures, and finally evaluate them to values.

- **[WA2](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/wa2)** WA2 is a command-line tool that helps you learn about AWS services. It was built with Node.js and published to npm.

- **[KeyPoint](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/keypoint)** This was the group final project for my Post-Graduate Certificate in IT program. It is blog website built with Java (JSP), MariaDB, JavaScript and Bootstrap.

- **[COVID19Stats](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/covid19stats)** A dashboard displaying the COVID19 statistics in all countries, built with React and TypeScript.

- **[goiter](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/goiter)** A demo showing how to implement an iterator (including infinite iterators) using Golang's channels. This is to show how similar Go's channels are to other lanuguages' iterators / generators.

- **[DoubleVisualizer](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/doublevisualizer)** A web page to show the make-up of a double float-point number.

- **[Magic Tower](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/Nand2Tetris/tree/master/project9)** The is the project that I built for the course [From NAND To Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/). It was built with a language which I implemented myself, and runs on a computer which I built myself. See [this video](https://youtu.be/03VlOt-UVdA) to watch me playing it.

- **[cv2020](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/cv2020)** My CV that helps me find my first internship. It was built with TypeScript, React and Material-UI and deployed on [GitHub Pages](https://coderyihaowang.github.io/cv2020/) Please note the content of this CV is not updated.

- **[CProjectsCollection](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/cprojectscollection)** Some console games built in the C programming language, including 2048, MineSweeper and more.

There are also some projects that I made while following some online courses. These are basically the same as the course material, with perhaps some light modifications. You may find them less original or interesting than the projects above. But I list them here just to keep a record of what I have explored.

- **[MeetUp](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/meetup)** This is the project I built when learning the course [ASP.Net Core API from scratch to master with Azure Deployment](https://www.udemy.com/course/asp-net-core-api-from-scratch-to-master-with-azure-deployment/). It is a .Net Core API that supports CRUD and role-based authentication. It was deployed on Azure WebApps but is no longer maintained.

- **[multi-docker](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/multi-docker)/[mult-k8s](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/multi-k8s)** The project that I built when I was learning the course [Docker and Kubernetes: the Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/course/docker-and-kubernetes-the-complete-guide/). It uses node, react, redis, postgres, docker, k8s, travisCI, AWS elastic beanstalk and GCP Kubernetes engine.

- **[princetonAlgorithms](https://github.com/CoderYihaoWang/princetonAlgorithms)** Some algorithm practices when I was learning the course [Algorithms](https://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/) by Princeton University.
